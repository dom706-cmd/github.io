    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>VeriSnap collects the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Photos:</strong> You can take photos using the app. These photos are saved only on your device and are not uploaded to our servers unless you choose to share them.</li>
        <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> When you take a photo, we collect the GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude) to embed in the photo's metadata. This location data is stored only on your device and is included in the photo if you choose to share it.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>The information we collect is used solely to provide the functionality of the app:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To add timestamps and GPS coordinates to your photos for verification purposes.</li>
        <li>To display your photos and their associated metadata within the app's gallery.</li>
        <li>To generate watermarked images for sharing, which include the timestamp and location.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not share, sell, or rent your personal data to third parties. Your photos and location data are stored locally on your device and are not transmitted to our servers. If you choose to share a photo, the shared image will include the embedded timestamp and location in the watermark.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>You retain full control over your data. You can delete photos at any time within the app, which will permanently remove them from your device.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal data. Since all data is stored locally on your device, you can manage it directly within the app.</p>
